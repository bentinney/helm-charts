<p>This check finds Helm releases that do not set <code>.Values.global.region</code>.</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Why is this a problem?</dt>
  <dd>
    We had some incidents where configuration for one region was accidentally deployed in
    a different region. The GkRegionValueMismatch check forbids such deployments, but
    for this check to be effective, we must be able to identify which region a Helm
    release belongs to.
  </dd>
  <dt>How to fix?</dt>
  <dd>
    Amend your deployment process to include the values file
    <code>$REGION/values/globals.yaml</code> or <code>scaleout/s-$REGION/values/globals.yaml</code>
    from the cc/secrets repo in your <code>helm upgrade</code> invocation. If you are using the
    shared Helm tasks, this is done by adjusting the <code>VALUES</code> parameter to include
    <code>local:globals</code> (for metal) or <code>s-local:globals</code> (for scaleout).
