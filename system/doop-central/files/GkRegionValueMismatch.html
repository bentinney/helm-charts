<p>This check finds Helm releases where <code>.Values.global.region</code> is set to a different region than the current one.</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Why is this a problem?</dt>
  <dd>
    We had some incidents where configuration for one region was accidentally deployed in a
    different region. This check forbids such misdirected deployments.
  </dd>
  <dt>How to fix?</dt>
  <dd>
    Prefer CI-driven over manual deployments to reduce the chance of human error. If you have to do
    a manual deployment, check that you're logged into the correct cluster before deploying.
